Digital Memories
================
By _digital memories_ I mean all digital media that allows me to recall memories of my life, whether audio, photo or video. This repository contains some scripts and brainstorming ideas for who I organize my digital memories. I publish it here, hoping it would be useful to somebody else. However, note that these scripts are very specific to my workflow, so you might need to adapt them before they fit yours. Do not hesitate to drop me a line if you have some ideas.
